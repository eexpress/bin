14.04的totem不能自动安装h.264等解码器了。安装ubuntu-restricted-extras是很傻的，居然强制另外下载ttf-mscorefonts-installer。
其实在totem的推荐中，包含了最重要的 gstreamer1.0-libav, gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad, gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly 包。
```
● as ~Dsuggests:gstreamer1.0-libav
p   gnome-sushi                                     - sushi is a quick previewer for nautilus                  
i   totem                                           - Simple media player for the GNOME desktop based on GStrea
```
真依赖的只有这几个。
```
● as ~Dgstreamer1.0-libav
p   gnome                                           - Full GNOME Desktop Environment, with extra components    
p   gstreamer1.0-libav-dbg                          - libav plugin for GStreamer (debug symbols)               
p   totem-plugin-arte                               - Totem plugin to watch streams from arte.tv               
p   transmageddon                                   - video transcoder for Linux and Unix systems built using G
```
gstreamer的包中，0.10的包，只是被aim/yahoo的帐号设置依赖，可以删除，只剩下2个系统依赖。
```
● ap ~igstreamer~nplugins~n0.10!(base-app|lib)
这样，0.10就剩下2个插件。
● as ~igstreamer~nplugins~n0.10
i   gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps      - GStreamer helper programs from the "base" set  
i   libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0      - GStreamer libraries from the "base" set   
```
1.0的插件，基本都安装了。 
```
● as ~igstreamer~nplugins!(0.10)
i   gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad             - GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set
